            We're so glad that our offer of UXDMC for free was so well received.
            So many people joined up over the past 2 months and it's been great
            to grow the community. <span class="important-text">The Free offer will be ending at the end of the
            month of April and the CARE code will continue to be good for 80% off
            any or all modules.</span>
